  <h1 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h1><p>This project is related to my dissertation research in pain management with Margolis pain-diagram <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2937007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Margolis, 1986)</a>. Pain management is a means of clinical analysis. The diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain and research need long-term pain collection and continuous analysis. They can help therapists make more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. Many of these studies have focused on providing an effective scientific approach to assessing chronic pain. Margolis, B., et al. have proposed using a rating system to manage pain information for medical purposes. Their rating system advocate drawing pain on diagram to reveal heuristic value. In this system, the body anatomy is divided into 45 different body parts and it provides each part with the opportunity for pain drawing. Referring to the pain diagram from the rating system, I designed and implemented an pain collection and management application – <a href="http://35.178.181.58/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Through My Pain</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Design-for-patients-or-“everyone”"><a href="#Design-for-patients-or-“everyone”" class="headerlink" title="Design for patients or “everyone”?"></a>Design for patients or “everyone”?</h2><blockquote>
<p>During the research, the initial question is who are main stackholders or objects of this project? Obviously, patient groups are most important research object and user, but the definition of patient population is relatively vague. How can an individual certainly be determined as a patient if their sympotoms are not discovered? Some patients have a serious disease even without any clue or sympotom. By the time these individuals were tested for their own disease, it was too late. I consider that this project, while helping complete the dissertation research, should also have a clear object orientation. Therefore, the stackholder is not just for the sick but for the avarage person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another point is, similarly, whether the therapist will join and use the app to help their patient. The answer is that it is both necessary and feasible. When defining user and function, it is important to consider how does the design solve the problem. In the process of analysing patients with chronic pain, the therapist plays an indispensable role. Thinking about the absence of therapist, when users use application to record pain, only depending on the software analysis method is not enough to get effective results. These effective results include whether you should go to hospital and whether you need clinical treatment.<br><br></p>
<p><hr></p>
<h1 id="Initializing-the-process"><a href="#Initializing-the-process" class="headerlink" title="Initializing the process"></a>Initializing the process</h1><p>In the beginning, for gathering ideas from stackholders, an initial survey was conducted. Under normal circumstances, some questionnaires may help to determine basic requirements. The information I get in this process varies. The statistical result were consistent with previous expectations. There are 59.1% participants believe that pain drawing can help them improve their health and are in need of long-term health monitoring. 63.6% participants willing to see the doctor if they get clue about their bad health condition. As a commercially viable solution may be far-fetched, but it has sufficient research value. For this “not that high” demand, a possible reason would be participants are from different culture and they may have different clinical service in their background. Most of them cannot imagine what kind of service the on-going health tracking would be, so much so that they think it doesn’t matter. </p>
<p>It can be seen that the initial survey helps to adjust the overall design target and improves accuracy of aiming user requirements. With the help of these information, I did some drafts from scratch. Drawing the interface on the paper is a handy way to get the point of entire design and it is also easy to be modified.<br><br></p>
<hr>

<h3 id="Design-rational"><a href="#Design-rational" class="headerlink" title="Design rational"></a>Design rational</h3><p>The design rational I should follow is same as the experience I want to provide to users. When there are many chooses between different interfaces, words and even technical solutions, following the predetermined design rational helps you standardize the entire style of the application so that it is not designed to look like anything else. During design process, I asked myself about what kind of experience I should provide in this health application. It is beyond just superficial functionality of this app. Considering the context in which this app will be used, the primary experience, as the most anticipated by the patient, should address the most basic and important needs of the user. </p>
<p>First, analysis of the application has several possible usage scenarios: daily use, clinical data collection, and long term ward recording. The internal requirements of users are obtained according to the preseted scenarios and potential scenarios. For example, in the case of daily use, users rarely have a large amount of time to specifically use this application. Therefore, fast and simplicity are necessary design rationales. Besides, data collection in the outpatient department is a fast process with high volume. Usually, it is the first time for patients to use the application. Clear interface design and concise use process can help with solving real problems. Third, long-term pain management need a progress that users use the app for a long time. Therapists will also collect information from the app. As an application that may be used for a long time, it should have practical value. To sum up, the application should be practical, concise and clear under the premise of meeting basic and key requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Practical<br>Meeting general functional requirements which contain key features of this applicaiton.</li>
<li>Concise<br>Remove unnecessary operations process. Simplify interface information and interactions.</li>
<li>Clear<br>Be articulate in wording and guiding. Providing fair and clear interface navigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="Drafting-the-Interface"><a href="#Drafting-the-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Drafting the Interface"></a>Drafting the Interface</h2><p>The fastest drafts are also the process with the most changes. The process of making the draft is similar to bringing the original idea to life. Although the idea has not been polished yet, it is enough to create the application process and interface design. Hand-drawing and using software tools are both good ways to create wireframes. Here, I used <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balsamiq</a> to draw my wireframes. In the process of making wireframes, I would encounter the situation of “do not know where to start”. At this time, I often have too many ideas in my mind, some of which are even contradictory. My approach is to start with the basics and write down the ideas. Organizing the thoughts to discover internal differences and relationships helps me find the right path to the point. </p>
<p>The use of Balsamiq in the process of wireframe design has some limitations. Preseted wireframes do not fully express some desired interface. For example, when designing the secondary navigation bar, the preseted wireframes cannot be changed, while what I want is the navigation bar without borders. Therefore, only solution would be modifying it later when making the high-fidelity design. Actually, hand-sketching or using original graphic applications may be a better way in this circumstance. </p>

<h3 id="Trying-A-B-test-in-the-experiment"><a href="#Trying-A-B-test-in-the-experiment" class="headerlink" title="Trying A/B test in the experiment"></a>Trying A/B test in the experiment</h3><p>The application is designed to assist dissertation research. The experimental study explore which method is more suitable for presenting pain on pain diagram. Participants draw differently according to their own pain, and an alternative rule is that they need to describe specific locations according to different painting methods. The reason for doing this is to get the experimental data of A/B test. The A/B test result delivered in this way mainly are feedback from participants. In the experiment, I labeled the interactive buttons and components in the wireframe with stickers of different colors, and then combined all the wireframes into a simulation application. Participants used this simulation application to record pain during the experiment.<br><br><br><img src="/images/ss7.svg" alt="Show case of different pain diagram design"></p>

<h2 id="Implementation-and-evaluation"><a href="#Implementation-and-evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Implementation and evaluation"></a>Implementation and evaluation</h2><p>Following the the UX process design, concrete implementation involved starts here. With wireframe support, code implementations are flowing. The initial technical solution was Flask + MySQL + Vue.js. Choosing Flask and MySQL because I am personally familiar with these two technologies. Flask also provides a relatively handy methods in implementing small applications. This framework is great for moving quickly from prototype to primary implementation. With the help of MySQL it can provide a relatively stable application experience.</p>
